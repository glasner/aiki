//! Flow composition with before/after orchestration and cycle detection.
//!
//! This module provides the [`HookComposer`] struct which orchestrates:
//! - Before hook execution (runs before this flow's actions)
//! - This flow's action execution (delegated to HookEngine)
//! - After hook execution (runs after this flow's actions)
//! - Cycle detection using a runtime call stack
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! User triggers event (e.g., change.completed)
//!     ↓
//! HookComposer.compose_hook("my-workflow.yml", state)
//!     ↓
//!     Loads flow via HookLoader
//!     Checks call stack for cycles
//!     ↓
//!     Executes before flows (each gets fresh variable context, shares event state)
//!     ↓
//!     Executes this flow's actions via HookEngine (fresh variable context, shares event state)
//!     ↓
//!     Executes after flows (each gets fresh variable context, shares event state)
//!     ↓
//!     Returns HookOutcome
//! ```
//!
//! # Isolation Model
//!
//! - **Variables are isolated**: Each flow gets a fresh variable context
//! - **Event state is shared**: All flows modify the same event object
//!   - Example: TurnStarted's ContextAssembler accumulates chunks from all flows
//!   - Example: TurnCompleted's autoreply builder accumulates from all flows
